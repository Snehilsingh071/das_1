## Problem Description

<p>Given two strings <code>s</code> and <code>t</code>, return <code>true</code><em> if </em><code>s</code><em> is a <strong>subsequence</strong> of </em><code>t</code><em>, or </em><code>false</code><em> otherwise</em>.</p>

<p>A <strong>subsequence</strong> of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., <code>"ace"</code> is a subsequence of <code>"<u>a</u>b<u>c</u>d<u>e</u>"</code> while <code>"aec"</code> is not).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
<strong>Output:</strong> true
</pre><p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
<strong>Output:</strong> false
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 100</code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= t.length &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>s</code> and <code>t</code> consist only of lowercase English letters.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Follow up:</strong> Suppose there are lots of incoming <code>s</code>, say <code>s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>, ..., s<sub>k</sub></code> where <code>k &gt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code>, and you want to check one by one to see if <code>t</code> has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

# Approach

**How I think about a solution:**

Simply, all we have to do is just to count characters for each string `s` and `t` and check if `t` has all characters of `s`, but problem is there is an order to find the characters.

```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
```
In this case, we need to find `a` in `t` at first. The next character we must find is `b` at the position after `a`, the last character is `c` at the position after `b`. That is kind of a challenging part of this question. It might be tough to use simple `HashMap` or `Set` because they don\'t have order of data.

That\'s why I just started thinking it with a very simple example like this.
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "abc"
```
In this case, if we check each character one by one in the both strings from beginning, we can return `true` and this simple example gave me a hint to solve this question.

I realized that if I have the same index number as length of `s` after I iterate though all characters, I can prove that I have subsequence in `t`. 

To prove that, I also check a simple `false` case like this.
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "abd"
```
In this case, when I iterate thorugh both strings from beginning, I stopped at index `2` in `s` which means I didn\'t find the last character `c` in `t`, so this is a `false` case because `index number for s(2)` is not equal to `length of s(3)`. I couldn\'t get to `the last position of s`. 

`The last position` means `the last index number + 1` because index usually starts from `0` and counting length of string starts from `1`.

From my thought process above, I tried to iterate thorough both strings from beginning at the same time. 

Let\'s recap what I said with this example.
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
```

```
target: a
s index: 0
t index: 0
```
The first target is `a`. Luckily, the first character of `t` is also `a`. 

```
found: a
Now I can think inputs like this Input: s = "bc", t = "hbgdc"

after the above,

s index: 1
t index: 1
```

Then, the next target is `b` but the next character of `t` is `h`, so now 
```
target: b

found: a
Now I can think inputs like this Input: s = "bc", t = "bgdc"

after the above,

s index: 1
t index: 2

```

The next character of `t` is `b`, I found `b` in `t`.
```
target: b

found: ab
Now I can think inputs like this Input: s = "c", t = "gdc"

after the above,

s index: 2
t index: 3
```

The next and next next character in `t` are `g` and `d`, so just increment `t index` from `3` to `5`.

Finally, I reached the last character in `t` and found `c`

```
target: c

found abc
Now I can think inputs like this Input: s = "", t = ""

after the above,

s index: 3
t index: 6
```

After the process, all I have to do is just to check if `s index(3)` is equal to `length of s(3)`.

```
Output: true
```

That\'s how I think about my solution. Let\'s see a real algorithm below.


**Algorithm Overview:**

1. Initialize two pointers, `sp` and `tp`, to 0 to represent the starting positions of the strings `s` and `t` respectively.
2. Iterate through the characters of both strings `s` and `t`, comparing characters at the corresponding positions.
3. If a matching character is found, move the pointer in `s` forward.
4. Always move the pointer in `t` forward.
5. Check if all characters in `s` have been matched in `t`.
6. Return `True` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, `False` otherwise.

**Detailed Explanation:**

1. Set `sp` and `tp` to 0, indicating the starting positions of `s` and `t` respectively.

2. Iterate through the characters of `s` and `t` using a while loop until either all characters in `s` have been matched or we reach the end of `t`.

   a. Check if the characters at `sp` in `s` and `tp` in `t` are equal.

   b. If they are equal, increment `sp` to move to the next character in `s`.

   c. Always increment `tp` to move forward in `t`.

3. After the loop, check if all characters in `s` have been matched. If `sp` is equal to the length of `s`, then `s` is a subsequence of `t`.

   a. Return `True` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`.

   b. Return `False` if `s` is not a subsequence of `t`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
`n` is longer length of input string (`s` or `t`).

- Space complexity: O(1)


```python []
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        sp = tp = 0

        while sp < len(s) and tp < len(t):
            if s[sp] == t[tp]:
                sp += 1
            tp += 1
        
        return sp == len(s)
```
```javascript []
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isSubsequence = function(s, t) {
    let sp = 0;
    let tp = 0;

    while (sp < s.length && tp < t.length) {
        if (s[sp] === t[tp]) {
            sp++;
        }
        tp++;
    }

    return sp === s.length;    
};
```
```java []
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        int sp = 0;
        int tp = 0;

        while (sp < s.length() && tp < t.length()) {
            if (s.charAt(sp) == t.charAt(tp)) {
                sp++;
            }
            tp++;
        }

        return sp == s.length();        
    }
}
```
```C++ []
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int sp = 0;
        int tp = 0;

        while (sp < s.length() && tp < t.length()) {
            if (s[sp] == t[tp]) {
                sp++;
            }
            tp++;
        }

        return sp == s.length();        
    }
};
```
